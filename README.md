M.Eng Project
==============
The following codebase is part of my Masters Project for my M.Eng CS degree at [Cornell University](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/). I am currently working with [Dr. Theodoros Damoulas](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~damoulas/Site/td.html), a post-doctoral associate of the Department of Computer Science. We, in turn, fall under the direction of [Dr. Carla Gomes](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/gomes/), the director of Cornell's newly founded [Institute for Computational Sustainability](http://www.cis.cornell.edu/ics/). My work involves working with machine learning code that operates on data from [Cornell's Ornithology Lab](http://www.birds.cornell.edu/).
mRVM
----
The goal of this code is to reproduce the mRVM1 and mRVM2 models as outlined in this [paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~damoulas/Site/publications_files/TNN-2010-P-1894.R2.pdf). mRVM stand for multi-class multi-kernel Relevance Vector Machine and is a Bayesian learning and classification model originally introduced by M. Tipping (2001).
